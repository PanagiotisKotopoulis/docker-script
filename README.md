# Docker Installation Script

## Disclaimer --> Still testing and modifying so use this at your own risk

This is a basic script specific for Ubuntu systems to install the Docker Engine where all the commands are taken from the official docker page https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

### Reason for Making this Script
I wanted to practice scripts and also save some time running individual commands to install Docker.

### How to run it

Change the permissions of the .sh file to make it executable with.
`chmod +x <your-new-file>.sh`

Run the installer with
`./your-new-file.sh`
